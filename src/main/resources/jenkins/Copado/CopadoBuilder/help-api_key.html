  Enter your Copado API Key. A personal API Key is generated from the Account Summary tab in Copado. This makes it easy to use the API.  <br /><br />
  To obtain a new personal API Key, navigate in Copado to the Account Summary tab - API Key and press the "Generate new API Key" button if you haven't done it already.  <br /><br />
  Please note that resetting/changing the API will require these values here to be updated too.
